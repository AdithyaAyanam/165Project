# eTang Portal System Enhancement
## Introduction
The eTang Portal System enhancement project aims to optimize the scheduling of health service appointments at UC Berkeley. This project addresses the key challenges of long wait times, limited availability, and disruptions caused by no-shows and late arrivals, with the goal of enhancing user satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Project Overview
## Purpose: To develop a more efficient system that reduces wait times, decreases no-shows, and enhances overall satisfaction.
## Challenges:
Long wait times.

Limited availability of appointment slots.

Disruptions from no-shows and late arrivals.
## Goals:
Enhance the scheduling system to better manage demand and supply.

Improve resource utilization to ensure more effective service delivery to students.

Implement features that prioritize reliability and reduce inefficiencies.
## System Components
 Login and Interface: Integration with university accounts to access the eTang portal.
 
 Appointment Selection: Options for primary care or mental health services, including selection of available doctors and time slots.
 
 Booking Process: Interface that allows students to select and confirm their preferred appointment times.
## Proposed Features
   Priority-Based Scheduling: Utilizes historical data to prioritize students with a track record of reliability.
   
   Real-Time Adjustments: Dynamically optimizes schedules to minimize the impact of disruptions.
   
   Sensitivity Analysis: Ensures the robustness of the model under various operational conditions.
# Technical Approach
Data Collection: Gathering comprehensive data on patient appointments, including duration, punctuality, no-shows, and cancellations.

Predictive Modeling: Applying statistical models (e.g., logistic regression, linear regression) to predict no-shows and appointment durations.

Model Optimization: Using linear programming techniques to allocate time slots effectively and adapt to real-time changes.
